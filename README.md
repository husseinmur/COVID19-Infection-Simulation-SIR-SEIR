# COVID-19 Infection Simulation
Simulating COVID-19 infections using a basic and a developed SIR models
An enhancement of the SIR model where I is divided into two groups:
- Symptomatic individuals
- Non-symptomatic individuals

An infected individual must be either symptomatic or non-symptomatic. He cannot be both.
This model is similar to the classical SIR model except that we assume that a symptomatic individual quarantines himself and infects no other individuals, where p is
the proportion of newly infected individuals who are symptomatic.
